## üß© Most Complex Parts

### üóÇÔ∏è State Management with NGXS

The most complex part of this demo is implementing **state management** using [NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io/). This is essential for managing and synchronizing application data across multiple components, specifically for:

- **Authentication** (`AuthState`)
- **Product Data** (`ProductState`)

Each state is responsible for its own set of actions, selectors, and side effects (such as API calls), ensuring the UI remains reactive and consistent.

### üö© Why Is It Complex?

Without a state management solution, handling shared data across components can become:

- **Messy and error-prone**: Data must be passed manually between components or stored in services, making it difficult to control updates and increasing the risk of bugs.
- **Unscalable**: As the app grows, maintaining a single source of truth or managing multiple copies of data in different components becomes challenging.
- **Critical for authentication and user-specific data**: Managing tokens, permissions, and user-specific product data (like favorites) requires clear, centralized logic to ensure stability and consistency.

### ‚úÖ How We Resolved It

We use **NGXS** to address these challenges because:

- **Declarative and Predictable**  
   State is defined via classes (`@State()`), and updates are triggered via actions (`@Action()`), making data flows predictable and easy to test.

- **Cleaner Code & Separation of Concerns**  
   NGXS encourages keeping business logic out of components, resulting in more maintainable and modular code.

- **Plugin Support**  
   NGXS offers plugins like the **NGXS Storage Plugin** to persist state (e.g., saving tokens to `localStorage`), making it easy to maintain user sessions across reloads.
